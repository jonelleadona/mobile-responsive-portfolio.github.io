          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <br>
          <p>My name is Jonelle, but you can also call me Jojo. I've embarked my coding journey back in August of 2020, when COVID19 was at it's worse. I graduated from the Univesity of Central Florida in May of 2020, but due to the world wide pandemic, my career opportunites were limited upon graduation. During my time seeking jobs within my degree window, I came up with idea that I wanted to learn something new and challanging. I've always been interested in web design, but I was always pushed into going into the health feild due to me growing up in a family full of healthcare providers. I took the leap and signed up for a coding bootcamp that was being taught in partnership with my alma mater. Six months later, after endless nights of tears, stress, and many cups of coffee, I was able to succefully complete the course. Right now I'm currently still practicing the skills that I've learned during my time as a student, but I'm also on the look for someone who would be willing to give me an opportunity to learn more. There's only so many sites that can teach me how to code, but experience is the best practice when it comes to true learning.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I'm originally from Orlanod, FL, but recently I moved to the Seattle area in Washington. I'm currently looking for any remote or local opportunites that are available. I'm knowledgeable in full stack development, but I find myself enjoying the front end portion more. I like the creativity and design that's involved with front end, but I'm also strongly motivated in diving more into back end developent as well.</p>

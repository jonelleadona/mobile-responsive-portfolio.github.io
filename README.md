# Responsive Portfolio Homework Assignment

For this assignment I created a working site that contains a responsive portfolio based on me. This site renders will on multiple screen variations such as smaller display monitors or for simple web browser resizing. This site may seem simple now, but it is only the beginning of my web develop journey. 

## Some Features to be Found:
- Responsive page layout 
- Collapsible navbar button 
- Sticky footer
